# Today's Mission: set up a reusable server/client framework for potential online card games

## TODOs
- [x] set up a proper backend (enter name & connect)
- [x] let clients create and join rooms
- [x] make it work locally
- [x] make it work on phones
- [ ] style it appropriately (2024: Don't be like Herbert!)
  - [x] proper background
  - [ ] icons which show whether a table is full or not (maybe even show how many players are sitting already)
  - [ ] find an elegant button style
  - [ ] find an elegant font
- [x] add a simple chat
- [ ] implement a first game (maybe try a simple & short logic but maybe more players or even an individual player number just for learning and testing purposes - could come in handy later on)
  - [ ] add CPU players
  - [Â ] with CPU players implemented offline/alone playability is guaranteed too
- [ ] handle potential connection/disconnection/timeout issues
  - [ ] last resort = CPU player taking a disconnected (offline too long?) player's seat
- [ ] online test on a proper server
- [ ] release a first simple game on a proper server
- [ ] release a first simple proper game as an app (~unlikely an iOS app)
- [ ] develop card games that do not exist yet
