# Today's Mission: set up a reusable server/client framework for potential online card games

## TODOs
- [x] set up a proper backend (enter name & connect)
- [x] let clients create and join rooms
- [x] make it work locally
- [x] make it work on phones
- [ ] add a simple chat
- [ ] implement a first game (maybe try a simple & short logic but maybe more players or even an individual player number just for learning and testing purposes - could come in handy later on)
- [ ] handle potential connection/disconnection/timeout issues
- [ ] online test on a proper server
- [ ] release a first simple game on a proper server
- [ ] release a first simple proper game as an app (~unlikely an iOS app)
- [ ] develop card games that do not exist yet
